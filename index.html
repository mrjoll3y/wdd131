            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="sidebyside">
                <p>I'm Callen Jolley, 23, from Firth, Idaho, near BYU-I. I've switched majors twiceâ€”from business management to accounting, 
                    and now to cybersecurity. I've been married for over a year and a half and have three cats. Sadly, we can't bring our 
                    purebred German Shepherd due to apartment rules. I'm the youngest of four, and my wife is the youngest of six. I enjoy 
                    soccer, camping, dirt biking, cooking, small farming, track and field, auto work, and landscaping. Our dream is to own 
                    a self-sustaining farm and wedding venue/animal rescue. Cybersecurity may not be directly related, but with my background 
                    in business and accounting, I see it as a way to achieve our goals. I'm working full-time while taking 14 credits this 
                    semester, so life is busy, but I make time for my hobbies, studies, and family. I hope to learn the basics of databases 
                    to apply data in business and agriculture, helping with future plans for a farm and rescue.
